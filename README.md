# Covid-Data-Analysis
I used Python to undertake exploratory data analysis as part of this Covid-19 data analysis project and to learn how to create a Covid-19 dashboard in Tableau. to have a better understanding of Covid-19's effects and immunisation rates in India. I plotted the global cases, deaths, and recoveries using Tableau.
